# Filigree: A Bit Sharing Cooperative

## Introduction
As with any cooperative, in which members pool their resources together for a reward greater than the sum of its parts, a bitshare is a community that shares computing and storage resources.

Filigree is a bitsharing cooperative for sharing storage that seeks to deliver the benefits of cloud data storage in a drastically more transparent and communal manner. For most people, cloud data storage is the only inexpensive way to secure personal files against the risks of data loss, but at the cost of sacrificing control over one's data. For most people, replicating the industry best-practices for data storage at home is prohibitively expensive. That is, until now.

Members of filigree donate operative control of a small computing device (but retrain ownership and possession) that is used as node in a cluster running a distributed replicated filesystem. In return, they receive access to a fault-tolerant storage cluster (potentially many terabytes in size). In the spirit of a coop, this storage space is a shared pool.

## Filament: The Filigree Appliance
Filaments are the computing appliances that pool their resources into the Filigree network. In principal, it doesn't matter *what* a Filament is, so long as each user has a nearly identical device (and hence, contributes a fair share of resources to the pool). 

### Features
#### 1. One-Touch Access
Turning a filigree-compliant device into a filament is as easy as plugging in an [inexpensive, low-profile USB thumb drive](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005FYNSZA/), that downloads Filament OS from the filigree network and boots to it. Filigree OS is kept entirely in-memory, making it ultra-fast and leaving a Filament's internal hard drive solely for storage.

#### 2. A Fuckton of Storage
Even with only four filaments attached, filigree members enjoy a shared pool of *twenty terabytes*. This is because each filament contributes five terabytes of storage.

#### 3. A *Secure* Fuckton of Storage
Files stored on the Filigree network are always stored on at least two filaments at any given time, ensuring that your files are always accessible. As more member join Filament, the number  of replicas made for each file can be increased. 

#### 4. Your Files, Anywhere
You can access the files you and your friends store on Filigree anywhere in the world. Filigree appears on your computer like any other folder (albeit, one with a *huge* capacity). Want to share a file with a friend who isn't in Filigree? Simple send them a shareable, temporary URL they can download the file from.


#### 5. Better Than Netflix
This is what you get when you plug your filament into your TV or monitor:

Filament OS comes armed with Kodi (formerly *XMBC*), giving you a stunning ten-foot display that can be controlled by an Xbox controller or IR remote.

#### 6. â€¦but *also* Netflix
Via Kodi, you can watch Netflix, too.

#### 7. A Sandbox For Everything Else
Distributed storage is something we're talking about right now simply because it is a well-explored area of distributed computing. With Filigree, you and your friends get a sandbox for fleshing out whatever hair-brained ideas you could bring to life on your very own cluster. 

#### 8. A Well-Marked Entrance
Since each filament contributes a huge amount of storage to filigree, each new person who joins the network adds value for everybody.

#### 9. A Well-Marked Exit
Thought Filigree was a good idea but then changed your mind? Duck out at any time! At no point do you cede ownership or possession of your Filament. It's yours to keep. And, because any files that happen to be stored on your device are guaranteed to be stored elsewhere on the filigree network, you need not fear your friends losing any of their files. As detailed in the Hardware section below, Filament is an incredibly capable device, even on its own. 

### Hardware
We've worked hard to make sure Filament is beautiful both inside and out while remaining inexpensive. Hardware-wise, Filament is very much a full computer. The Mini-ITX motherboard is capable of housing any processor matching its socket and memory may be upgraded with the same ease of any desktop computer. The Realan W-80 case that houses Filament is machined from aluminum and is the smallest case we could find on the market that could pack in a full 3.5" HDD, measuring a mere three inches tall.

Below is a tentative parts list reflecting a devices that is compliant with Filigree, optimized for price:

Type|Item|Price
:----|:----|:----
**CPU** | [\*AMD 2650 1.45Ghz Dual-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-sd2650jahmbox) | $24.98 @ NCIX US 
**Motherboard** | [Asus AM1I-A Mini ITX AM1 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-am1ia) | $36.04 @ Mwave 
**Memory** | [\*Patriot Signature 4GB (1 x 4GB) DDR3-1333 Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/patriot-memory-psd34g133381) | $19.99 @ Amazon 
**Storage** | [\*Toshiba  5TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/toshiba-internal-hard-drive-ph3500u1i72) | $139.99 @ Amazon 
**Other**| Realan W-80 Silver Aluminium Mini-ITX Case| $79.99 
 **Total** | | **$300.99**
These parts are subject to change based on market prices or if Filigree members express a strong preference towards Intel over AMD. The cost of a 5Tb HDD (presently accounting for nearly 50% of Filament's total cost) is likely to decrease further.
