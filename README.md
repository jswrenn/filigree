# Filament
## A Bitsharing Cooperative

As with any cooperative, in which members pool their resources together
for a reward greater than the sum of its parts, a bitshare is a
community that shares computing and storage resources. 

Filament is a bitsharing cooperative for sharing storage that seeks
to deliver the benefits of cloud data storage in a drastically more
transparent and communal manner. For most people, cloud data storage
is the only inexpensive way to secure personal files against the risks
of data loss, but at the cost of sacrificing control over one's data.
For most people, replicating the industry best-practices for data
storage at home is prohibitively expensive. That is, until now.
